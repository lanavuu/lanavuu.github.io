## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

* Lab 4, part-1

    I enjoyed this lab because I learned a lot about functions and I especially cleared up some confusions I had with parameters by experimenting with them. I thought that this lab was very helpful on practicing writing functions and visually seeing how these functions can get passed through other functions. Overall, the purpose of this lab was to allow students to have a better understanding about functions by coding functions, and this may have been difficult when first approached but once the concept is grasped it becomes easier to understand.

* Lab 6, part-1

    This is my second favorite lab because this part of the lab helped me understand what a command line is and how it can be used in programming. I like how when we are first introduced to command lines, we are given a simple task that was not too difficult/vague to figure out the code or purpose. The purpose of this lab is to guide students to programming code where command lines and user input is involved in a particular way, such as storing different arguments into different variables.

* Lab 9, part-2

    This was my third favorite lab because I learned a lot about input/output files and what ofstream does. I was very confused and knew nothing about these topics and I did not know what it would be used for, but after using it in this lab and figuring things out I now see how I/O files can be used in different types of programs. I also liked how this lab showed me how everything we learned from previous labs is also used in this lab, such as the command lines and if statements. The purpose of this program was to get students to get familiar with using multiple files in their programs.
